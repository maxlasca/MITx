#when i started
In January 2023 I decided to start learning
Python. I tried several times but I never could
keep learning more than two days. The motivation
is faded in a couple of hours when I realized that
it was complicated to gain knowledge. Hopefully, I began
playing tennis (of course I began to learn how to play it
because I had never had a racket in my hand) and I learned
that if I wanted to get a progress I had to work in my discipline.
So, here I am, trying to learn Python. The aim of this is to share
my progress, re-use my code, re-viit it, improve it, and also maybe 
help the starters like me.

The main content are exercises that i did for this course and some of them
were deliverables that i like it so i kept working on my own.

I hope this is a great beginning for my career and life!
